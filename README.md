## Credit and Collaborations

### Team Agreement

#### Logistical

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
  * Meet at 1:30PM and aim to finish work for the day by 6:00 PM
* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  * We will use Slack for communication, and Remo for collaboration
* How often will you take breaks?
  * We will take a 10 minute break every hour on the hour as we work.
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  * Calling on TA's for assistance when stuck, possibly communicating with instructors if severely behind

#### Cooperative

* Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  * Joseph: Reading docs, strong in front end work.
  * Andrew: Back end work
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  * Sounds like we have a good compliment. Andrew can leverage strength on back end work, while Joseph can do the same for front end.
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  * Andrew: Development of a plan before hopping into coding. Pseudo code. Making more frequent commits.
  * Joseph: Planning code to be modular and easy to read upon initial writing.
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  * Pair programming will help everyone know what's going on, go over the days work before and during retros.

#### Conflict Resolution

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  * Say something to one another, maintain open communication during coding sessions.
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  * Maintain open communication, possibly seek third party mediation if necessary.
* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  * Let each member work to their strengths, being to explain a process if necessary during coding.
